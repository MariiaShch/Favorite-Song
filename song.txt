D'you breathe the name of your saviour
In your hour of need?
And taste the blame if the flavor
Should remind you of greed
Of implication, insinuation, and ill-will
'Til you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil
Come closing in for a kill
Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love, my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust, oh
It's all a game, avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior
And the things we don't need
I lust for after, no disaster can touch
Touch us anymore
And more than ever, I hope to never fall
Where enough is not the same it was before
Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love, my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love, my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust (carnival of rust)
